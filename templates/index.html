    <h1 class="heading">Spider through Web</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Web Scraping Site!!! In this page, we scrape web pages using Scrapy.</p>
    <p>Web scraping is the process of extracting information from websites automatically. 
        It allows you to gather data from various sources on the internet quickly and efficiently.</p>
    <p>Scrapy is a powerful and flexible Python framework used for web scraping. 
        It provides built-in support for handling requests, managing cookies, and parsing data from HTML, XML, and JSON.</p>
    <h2>Example: Scraping Quotes</h2>
    <p>Let's see a simple example of how Scrapy works. 
        Below is a spider that extracts quotes and their authors from the website "http://quotes.toscrape.com".</p>
    <div class="container" style="border-style: double;">
        <pre>
import scrapy

class QuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'quotes'
    start_urls = ['http://quotes.toscrape.com']

    def parse(self, response):
        for quote in response.css('div.quote'):
            text = quote.css('span.text::text').get()
            author = quote.css('span small.author::text').get()
            yield {
                'quote': text,
                'author': author,
            }

        next_page = response.css('li.next a::attr(href)').get()
        if next_page is not None:
            yield response.follow(next_page, self.parse)
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>This spider will extract quotes and their authors from the website and follow pagination links to scrape multiple
        pages of quotes.</p>
    <p>With Scrapy, you can build more complex spiders to scrape data from various websites and save it in different
        formats such as CSV, JSON, or databases.</p>
